Kevin, just giving me grief about practice. 
Just because he’s a senior, he seems to think 
it’s his right to be a jerk or something. 
But whatever, I guess that’s the way it goes.

Whoa. What’s going on?  
I had no idea you had such bad feelings 
towards Kevin.

***

What’s up, man? 
Did Kevin start with 
you or something?

***

You mean at the 
beginning of the year? 
You can trust me. 

***

That’s really awful, man.

***
Look I’m here for you. 
I remember seeing this 
website advertised on 
the bus about this stuff. 
Do you maybe want to check 
that out together? 

***
Yeah, let’s take a look.
