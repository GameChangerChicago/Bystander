$Sexual assault is an act of aggression, no matter who the victim is. 
*$And it’s important to remember that while the majority of victims of sexual assault are women,  men too can be victims of assault. 
*$In the next story we outline some other important bystander behaviors. 
*|Who’s that texting you? 
*\Kevin, just giving me grief about practice. 
*\Just because he’s a senior, he seems to think it’s his right to be a jerk all the time. 
*|Kevin? Why are you texting with him??? 
*|I HATE him. 
*|If I could get my hands on him for just one second… 
*\Whoa. What’s going on?  
*\I had no idea you had such bad feelings towards Kevin. 
*|Yeah well, I didn’t until… I don’t know. 
*|I don’t know how to say this. I’ve been trying to forget it and pretend it didn’t happen, but I can’t. 
*|You have to swear not to say anything, but something weird happened, with Kevin and the others, during tryouts. 
*|I feel like if I don’t say something I’m going to go crazy. 
*\You mean at the beginning of the year? 
*\You can trust me. 
*|Okay. It was one of the last days of tryouts. 
*|Everyone had left already and I thought I was by myself in the locker room. 
*|Then Kevin, Jacob, and Tyler busted in acting like the President or something...you know how they are. 
*|They started giving me a hard time about how I’d never make drumline, like they do with all the underclassmen. 
*|They were just kind of joking, pushing me and hitting me with the gym towels but then... 
*|I don’t know. Kev and Jacob pushed me against the locker and I could move. They pulled down my pants and...did some stuff to me. 
*|It was so messed up. I just wanted to get out of there. 
*|They told me if I said anything, they’d be sure that I didn’t make drumline. 
*\That’s really awful, man. 
*\I’m here for you. 
*\I remember seeing this website advertised on the bus about this stuff. Do you maybe want to check that out together? 
*|That sounds okay. I just don’t know what to do and I don’t want him to get away with it. 
*\Yeah, let’s take a look.
