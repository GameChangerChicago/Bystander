$Sexual assault is an act of aggression, no matter who the victim is.

*$In the next story we outline some other important bystander behaviors. 
*|Who’s that texting you? 
*\Kevin. Hasseling me about practice again. 
*\Just because he’s a senior, he thinks it’s his right to be up in everyone’s business. 
*|Why are you texting with HIM? He’s nothing more than a no-good... 
*\What’s going on?  I had no idea you had such beef with Kevin. 
*|Yeah well, I didn’t until...I don’t know. 
*|I don’t know how to say this. I’ve been trying to forget and pretend that it didn’t happen. I just can’t. 
*|You have to swear not to say anything. 
*\You can trust me. 
*|It was one of the last days of tryouts. I thought everyone had left already and that I was by myself in the locker room. 
*|Then Kevin, Jacob, and Tyler busted in acting like the President or something...you know how they are. 
*\Yeah. 
*|They started giving me a hard time about how I’d never make drumline. 
*|They were joking, pushing me and hitting me with the gym towels but then... I don’t know. 
*|Kev and Jacob pushed me against the locker and I couldn't move. They pulled down my shorts and...did some stuff to me. 
*|It was so messed up. I just wanted to get out of there. They told me if I said anything, he’d be sure that I didn’t make drumline this year. 
*\What? That’s so messed up. I’m gonna hunt each and every one of them and… 
*|No, man. That’s not how I want to handle this. 
*\Okay, you’re right. Look, I’m here for you, anything you need. 
*|Thanks. I just don’t know what to do , but I don’t want them to get away with this. 
*\Well, I remember seeing a website on the bus about this stuff. Maybe we could check that out? 
*|Okay, let’s take a look.
