Who’s that texting you?|
***
Why are you texting with him? |
If I could get my hands on him |
for just one second…|
***
Bad feelings. I don’t - I don’t | 
even know how to say this. |
I’ve been trying to forget it |
and pretend that it didn’t happen, |
but I just can’t. I feel like if |
I don’t say something I’m going to go crazy.|
***
You have to swear not to say anything, |
but something weird happened, |
with Kevin, during tryouts.|
***
Yeah. It was one of the |
last days of tryouts. Everyone had |
left already and I thought I was by |
myself in the locker room when Kevin, |
Jacob, and Tyler busted in acting like |
the President or something...you know |
how they are. They started giving me a |
hard time about how I’d never make drumline, |
like they do with all the underclassmen.|
***
I was just getting ready to go home. |
They were just kind of joking, pushing |
me and hitting me with the gym towels but |
then... I don’t know. Kev and Jacob pushed |
me against the locker and I could move. |
They pulled down my pants and...did some |
stuff to me. It was messed up and I just |
wanted to get out of there. They told me if |
I said anything, he’d be sure that I didn’t |
make drumline this year.|
***
I guess I just can’t hold it |
in any longer. I don’t know what to do.|
***
Yeah, I guess that sounds okay. |
I just don’t know what to do and |
I don’t want him to get away with it.|
