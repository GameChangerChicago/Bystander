Who’s that texting you? 
*\Kevin, just giving me grief about practice. 
*\Just because he’s a senior, he seems to think it’s his right to be a jerk all the time. 
*|Kevin? Why are you texting with him??? 
*|I HATE him. 
*|If I could get my hands on him for just one second… 
*\Whoa. What’s going on?  
*\I had no idea you had such bad feelings towards Kevin. 


You mean at the 
beginning of the year? 
You can trust me.

Look I’m here for you. 
I remember seeing this 
website advertised on 
the bus about this stuff. 
Do you maybe want to check 
that out together?

Yeah, let’s take a look.
