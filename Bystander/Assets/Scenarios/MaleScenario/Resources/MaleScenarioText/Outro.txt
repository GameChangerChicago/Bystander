\Yeah, there’s a national hotline at: 1-800-656-HOPE. It also says there’s hotlines in specific states or cities, too. 
*\They have counselors 24/7. It says they can get you connected to a local counselor or help you decide if you want to report to the police. 
*|Yeah, it’s a lot to think about, but it's good I have options. 
*\Well whatever you decide to do, I support you. It’s difficult to share this kind of thing, but I’m glad you told me. 
*|Thanks for being there for me. 
*$As you saw in this last scenario, men can experience sexual assault, too. Men can be assaulted by males or females, peers or authority figures. 
*$Sexual assault has nothing to do with a victim’s ability to stick up for themselves or their sexual orientation. 
*$Being assaulted by a member of the same sex does not change your sexual orientation or make you “gay”. 
*$As I mentioned before, sexual assault is an act of violence and is used as a way to control and harm others.
