\Yeah, there’s a national hotline at: 1-800-656-HOPE. It also says there’s hotlines in specific states or cities, too. 
*\Do you think you want to call? They might be able to give some advice since they have counselors 24/7. 
*\It says they can get you connected to a local counselor or help you decide if you want to report to the police. 
*\We could also talk to someone at school first like the counselor or a teacher you trust. 
*|Yeah, I guess I just don’t know. But I could call and see if they can help. 
*\Well whatever you decide to do, I support you. I think it’s pretty difficult to share this, but I’m glad you told me. 
*|Thanks, I really appreciate it. I don’t know when I’ll feel better, but I think this is a start. 
*$As you saw in this last scenario, men can experience sexual assault, too. Men can be assaulted by males or females, peers or authority figures. 
*$Sexual assault has nothing to do with a victim’s ability to stick up for themselves or their sexual orientation. 
*$Being assaulted by a member of the same sex does not change your sexual orientation or make you “gay”. 
*$As I mentioned before, sexual assault is an act of violence and is used as a way to control and harm others.
