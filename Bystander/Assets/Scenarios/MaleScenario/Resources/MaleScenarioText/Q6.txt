\This is pretty graphic, but the FBI gives a criminal definition of rape as vaginal or anal penetration 
*\with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. 
*\By this definition other kinds of unwanted touching can be considered sexual assault and are also illegal. 
*|What do they mean by consent? 
*@Both people need to take part. And if you say “no” or are ___________  there is no consent.
