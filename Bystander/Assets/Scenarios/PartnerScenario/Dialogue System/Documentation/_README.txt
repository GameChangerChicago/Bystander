/*
This folder contains complete documentation for the Dialogue System.

Do NOT unzip it into your Assets folder! It contains Doxygen-generated JavaScript files; if these
are in the Assets folder, Unity will try to compile them and fail. If you want an offline copy of
the documentation, unzip it outside of your Assets folder.
