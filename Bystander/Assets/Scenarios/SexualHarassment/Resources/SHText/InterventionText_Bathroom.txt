!Janet, I’m sorry about bad stuff going around about you? Are you doing okay? !
@Yazmin, how would you like it if someone were tagging rumors about you? Or your little sis? @
#Yazmin, we’re friends right? I know you’ve got issues with Janet, but you need to stop it. This graffiti is harassment and you could get in a lot of trouble. #
$I use this bathroom too, Yazmin, and seeing stuff like this makes me uncomfortable. I think you should cut the tagging. $
