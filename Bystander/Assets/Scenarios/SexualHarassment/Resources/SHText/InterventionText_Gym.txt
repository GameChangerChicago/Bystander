!Yo, Carlos. You doing ok? I've seen how Steph grabs at you sometimes and it's been bothering me. !
@Steph, I know you really wouldn’t like it if someone was always grabbing at you like that. @
#Hey Steph, you've got to lay off Carlos. We're friends, so I'm letting you know he looks really uncomfortable when you're always trying to touch him. #
$I feel uncomfortable about the way you're always touching Carlos. I think it would be best if you gave him some space. $
